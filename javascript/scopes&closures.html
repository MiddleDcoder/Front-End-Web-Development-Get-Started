    <h1>This is Scopes & Closures of Javascript lessons</h1>
<p>scopes - JavaScript has two scopes – global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.</p>
 <p>closures - A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables — a scope chain. ... it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets. it has access to the outer function's variables. it has access to the global variables.</p>

        var utilities = getUtilities();
        var setting = getLocalStorageSettings();

        }

            setttings = getDefaultSettings();
        }

        window.app = {
            utilities: utilities,

//Closures Example
function ajax(cb){
    setTimeout(function() {
        cb('Approved');
    }, 1000);
}

function showUserApproval() {
    var user = { name: 'Joe Eames'}

    return function(){
        console.log(user.name);
    }
}

var newFunc = showUserApproval();
newFunc();

//another example of scopes
var inGlobal = true;

// this code will not gonna work because the variable someMsg is in scope not a global 
//console.log(someMsg);

function testMe(){
    console.log("testMe(): " + inGlobal);
    
    //this is the scoped code
    //someMsg variable can only be access at this function testMe()
    //this is called SCOPE
    var someMsg = "Some Message";
    console.log("testMe(): " + someMsg);

}
//this is error
// console.log("global: " + someMsg);
testMe();


//Closures another Example
//Closure is allow access to outer variable within inner scopes



    //scope lessons
        //NOTE this code won't run, but only explaining the purpose of closure
    var inGlobal = true;

    function testMe() {
        console.log("testMe(): " + inGlobal);

        //var someMsg = "some Message"; ----------- this code is in a scope
        var someMsg = "some Message";
        console.log("testMe(); " + someMsg);

        showItThen("with Closure", function (){
            //it's necessary for this additonal callback to access the variable someMsg
            //this is called a CLOSURE
        showIt("testMe With Closure(); " + someMsg);
        });

    }
    //output
    //with Closure
    //testMe With Closure(); some Message

    //NOTE
    /* Closures are made up of Scopes if a Scope can access a variable from an inner scope this is called CLOSURE
    * Scope are made up of Function if a Function have variable that can only be access within a function is called SCOPE
